NOTES::
1) "DMRG Truncation Error" is minimum Discarded weight
2) Give always Jp=Jm=Jz/2
3) for "DMRG FINITE Loops" write -(Target_L/2 -2) Target_L -4
4)"Calculating demanded set of Correlations =" does not work
5) if saving , have to stop the sweep in "right direction". It will be changed later
6) Similarly if restarting, have to start from "left direction"
7) Target state in standard DMRG = nonzero does not work, keep it zero. have to checked later
